# Categorizing the elements of the modern web

In the world of the web, what is a web app and what is a website is now often blended. It’s not as simple as written content is a website, and an interactive tool is a web app. Blogs can be interactive, they can provide tools, live searching, etc.

This is a high level overview of what fits where, of which rules apply to what elements. It’s mainly for myself to help me develop tools.

## Content vs its Vehicle

### Content

- Navigation (Primary, Sidebar, etc)
- Markdown
- Images
- Video

### Site or App itself

- CSS
- JavaScript
- Components
- Icons

## Mutable vs Immutable

### Mutable Entities
