# Linked: I assure you, medieval people bathed by Dr Eleanor Janega

> Medieval people also regularly washed both their hands and faces both before and after meals when in between baths because – stay with me here – they knew that first and grime could be hazardous to their health if ingested. Yes. They did. They really really did.

I love the mix of the sassy tone and passion for information that [is written here](https://going-medieval.com/2019/08/02/i-assure-you-medieval-people-bathed/).
