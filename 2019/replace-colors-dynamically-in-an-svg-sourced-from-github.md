# Replace colors dynamically in an SVG sourced from GitHub

Worked today on an idea I’ve had floating around — using Cloudflare Workers to load an SVG from GitHub, then do some fill colour changing which means you can avoid manually adding it to your project and editing it. Also Cloudflare Workers acts as fast as a CDN.

<iframe title="Collected SVG Replace Colors" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" width="500" height="750" src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/collected-svg-replace-colors-3kkxc?autoresize=1#?secret=7qT4IB25cE" data-secret="7qT4IB25cE"></iframe>

I have a whole umbrella of ideas that relate to querying and processing content without having to manage anything. It would be interesting to offer for free, but it would likely get expensive without sponsorship.

Another more ambitious idea is some sort of membership that gives you access to video and written tutorials plus this managed content service.
