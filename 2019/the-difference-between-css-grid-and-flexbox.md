> For y'all that have an understand of both CSS grid and flexbox, what's your favorite way of explaining the difference?

[Jen Simmons](https://twitter.com/jensimmons/status/1089181330133450752):

> Grid makes actual columns and rows. Content will line up from one to the other, as you ask it to. Flexbox doesn’t. Not only in the second dimension (which is easiest to talk about), but also in the first dimension. Flexbox isn’t for most of the things we’ve been using it for.
>
> Flexbox looks at content sizing, extra available space, and let’s you program what to do with the extra/ lack of space around that content. 
> 
> Grid let’s you define track sizes, and place content according to the track lines. Let’s you program a actual layout.
