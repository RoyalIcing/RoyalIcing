# Why I hate WordPress but used it anyway for this blog

1.  It gets me writing,
2.  And not wrangling with code.
3.  I get online editing, drafts, Ulysses integration out of the box.
4.  I can make edits and publish from my phone.
5.  My readers get RSS out of the box.
6.  The default 2019 theme looks decent.
7.  It brings categories, pagination, some decent plugins (and some hacky ones).
8.  It renders on the server instead of the client, bringing better SEO.
9.  It _doesnâ€™t_ use service workers which I think applied naively is premature optimisation and a worse user experience.
