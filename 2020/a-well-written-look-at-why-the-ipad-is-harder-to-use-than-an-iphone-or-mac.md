# A well-written look at why the iPad is harder to use than an iPhone or Mac

[John Gruber writes](https://daringfireball.net/2020/01/the_ipad_awkwardly_turns_10) why the iPadâ€™s multitasking UI mental model can be extremely confusing.

I believe the whole app launching & icons sitting on the home screen model should be rethought. If you were to design it from scratch today, I believe you would arrive at a more intuitive and simpler system. Rearranging icons is a chore. Drag and drop feels like balancing an egg on a fork. Most of it is undiscoverable.

The iPad has the chance to be an amazing device but the system software is frustrating.
