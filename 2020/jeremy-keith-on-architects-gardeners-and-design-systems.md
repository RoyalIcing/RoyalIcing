# Jeremy Keith on Architects, gardeners, and design systems

[Jeremy Keith:](https://adactio.com/journal/16369)

> It’s rare to find job titles like software gardener, or information librarian (even though they would be just as valid as other terms we’ve made up like software engineer or information architect). Outside of the context of open source projects, we don’t talk much about maintenance. We’re much more likely to talk about making.
>
> Anyone who’s spent any time working on design systems can tell you there’s no shortage of enthusiasm for architecture and making—“let’s build a library of components!”
> 
> There’s less enthusiasm for gardening, care, communication and maintenance. But that’s where the really important work happens.
