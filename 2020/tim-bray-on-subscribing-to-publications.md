# Tim Bray on subscribing to publications

Tim Bray writes why he [won’t subscribe](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/09/25/Subscription-Overload):

> Their arithmetic didn’t consider their chance of getting me to click on “Subscribe.” In my particular case, that chance is almost exactly Zero. I subscribe to enough things and I am acutely reluctant to give anyone else the ability to make regular withdrawals from my bank account. … It’s exactly because I’ve done some subscribing that I’m just not gonna do any more.
