# Examples of modes

[Guillermo Rauch said](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1736788829670093034) “One of my North Stars in design is No Modes, or mode minimization. It takes a lot of hard work and ingenuity to get there.”

[Francisco Hanna asked](https://twitter.com/fhanna92/status/1736802265015759329) “What is a modern example of an application with modes? Besides the vim and emacs examples in the article.”

So here’s a list of many modes in our smartphone and online worlds:

## In modern apps

- Editing vs viewing a photo
- Browser’s incognito mode
- Bezier path edit points mode
- Maps turn-by-turn directions
- Editing iPhone home screen
- Camera night mode
- Full screening a YouTube video
- Dark mode
- Do not disturb
- Airplane & low power mode
- Cookie consent pop-up (did the user tap “Accept” or “Decline”?)
- Subscription pricing tiers
- Browser’s reader mode
- Offline mode
- macOS Sonoma’s game mode

## In web development

- `CI=true` env variable
- `NODE_ENV=production` vs `NODE_ENV=development`
- `async function` vs `function`
- Code that checks `typeof window === 'undefined'`
- Server vs client rendering a React component
- `package.json`’s `type` of `module` vs `commonjs`
- HTTP `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`
- User agent sniffing e.g. detecting search engine crawler or a particular browser
