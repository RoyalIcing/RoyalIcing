# Patrick Smith — Product Developer & Design Engineer

- 🕸️ I’m working on tooling for WebAssembly like [Orb](https://github.com/RoyalIcing/Orb) and demos at [Calculated.World](https://calculated.world)
- 💡 I'm working on [collected.press](https://collected.press/) to create buildless sites and blogs. It’s what [this site](https://icing.space/) you are currently reading is built with. The content is fetched directly from a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RoyalIcing/RoyalIcing) and then rendered on-the-fly on a CloudFlare edge server.
- 🔭 I’m currently writing up my conceptual approach to UI development at [components.guide](https://components.guide/).
- 🐝 I'm working on [lilapi.com](https://lilapi.com/) to quickly generate dynamic images, such as for Open Graph images.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Elixir, WebAssembly, Rust, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, Golang, and writing and making [podcasts](https://lilapi.com/podcast) & [video](https://www.youtube.com/@PatrickGWSmith).
- I’m fascinated by the intersection between user experience design, software engineering, and product strategy.
- I’m @royalicing on [Mastodon](http://hachyderm.io/@royalicing) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/royalicing) / [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/royalicing.bsky.social).
- he/him, Patrick
