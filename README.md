# Patrick Smith — Product Developer & Design Engineer

- 💡 I'm working on [collected.press](https://collected.press/) to create buildless sites and blogs. It’s what this site you are currently reading is built with. The content is fetched from a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RoyalIcing/RoyalIcing) via CDN and then rendered on a CloudFlare edge server.
- 🔭 I’m currently writing up my conceptual approach to UI development at [components.guide](https://components.guide/).
- 🐝 I'm working on [lilapi.com](https://lilapi.com/) to quickly generate dynamic images, such as for Open Graph images.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Elixir, Web Assembly, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, Golang, and also how to write well.
- I’m fascinated by the intersection between user experience design, software engineering, and product strategy.
- I’m @royalicing on [Mastodon](http://hachyderm.io/@royalicing) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/royalicing).
