# Patrick Smith — Product Developer & Design Engineer

- 🕸️ I’m working on tooling for WebAssembly like [Orb](https://github.com/RoyalIcing/Orb) and demos at [Calculated.World](https://calculated.world)
- 💡 I'm working on [collected.press](https://collected.press/) to create buildless sites and blogs. It’s what [this site](https://icing.space/) you are currently reading is built with. The content is fetched directly from a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RoyalIcing/RoyalIcing) and then rendered on-the-fly on a CloudFlare edge server.
- 🪺 I’ve written up my approach to building UIs at [components.guide](https://components.guide/).
- 🌱 I’m enjoy creating with Elixir, WebAssembly, Rust, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, Golang, putting words into writing, and making [video](https://www.youtube.com/@PatrickGWSmith).
- 💬 I’m fascinated by the intersection between user experience design, software engineering, and product strategy, all of which I talk about on my podcast [Runtime Reverie](https://runtimereverie.com).
